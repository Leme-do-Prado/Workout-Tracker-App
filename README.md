This is the a practice project of the 100 Days of Code course, ministrated by Angela Yu and available on Udemy.com. This program is an API-based (Sheety and Nutritionix) Workout Tracking app â€” it obtains information through user input, naturally processing the data through the Nutritionix API, and later uploads it on a Google Sheet (via Sheety)!
